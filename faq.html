<p>Q. What is this?</p>
<p>A. Accelerationist Coin, or $FAST, is a meme coin on the Kaspa GHOSTDAG protocol. We have chosen Kaspa over traditional blockchains because it is currently the fastest open-source, decentralized, fully scalable Layer-1 in the world. For more details on the what and the why of our accelerationist stance, see our Mission Statement.</p>
<p>Q. How do I get the coin?</p>
<p>A. You can get the coin by meeting the 3 requirements below:</p>
<p>1. You must be a Kaspa Discord member with whom we&rsquo;ve made personal contact or who has reached out to us.<br />2. You must have been on the Kaspa Discord for at least 30 days at the time of you reaching out (this does not apply if we reach out to you).<br />3. You must follow us on X/Twitter and prove in some way that you and your Discord account belong to the same person.</p>
<p>NOTE: we are flexible on this, and we are open to considering individuals on a case by case basis if you DM us on X/Twitter or Discord.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mission Statement</span></strong></p>
<p><br />&ldquo;Speed now illuminates reality whereas light once gave objects of the world their shape.&rdquo;<br />― Paul Virilio, The Administration of Fear</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing human makes it out of the near-future.&rdquo;<br />― Nick Land</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The future is nothing but speed, nothing but acceleration.</p>
<p>If Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper&rsquo; obscurely envisaged culture to come then Kaspa accelerates that culture to its terminal limit, seeking to operate as fast as internet speed allows. Kaspa&rsquo;s two primary vectors in terms of adding to Bitcoin&rsquo;s economic revolution are the speed of transaction-inclusion in the ledger and the control over transaction-ordering in the ledger.</p>
<p>What, however, of a coin that represents only the former of Kaspa&rsquo;s two vectors in its purest form? A coin, the sole purpose of which is to represent the acceleration of economics itself? A coin of acceleration. An accelerationist coin. Or, FAST Coin.</p>
<p>In the words of Land, Capital is machinic (non-instrumental) globalization-miniaturization scaling dilation: an automatizing nihilist vortex, neutralizing all values through commensuration to digitized commerce (Meltdown), and we say, why not finally put a tokenomic face to the ur-plasticity that is capital and Capitalism.</p>
<p>Why are we doing this?</p>
<p>Because monetary economic acceleration needs a mascot, it needs a clear sign. Not just for the economic transaction or value, but positively for the speed of the economy itself. A cryptocurrency signifier of everything fast. A tokenized figurehead of the future arriving. In this manner, FAST Coin is the signifier of acceleration itself, the waymarker for the future, ever-accelerating up the peaks of economic oblivion.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; of FAST Coin, then, was already decided wherein the market first ever computed a transaction. Since that day capitalism has only ever been waiting for its quirky, snail representative. The decision to create is only ever because one can.</p>
<p><br />What are we going to spend it on?</p>
<p>FAST will have 100,000,000 total coins. <br />11% will go to the founders (1% each). <br />10% will go to the FAST DAO. <br />5% to liquidity.<br />1% to Nick Land<br />1% to a Landian Public Burn<br />2% for Grants relating to Accelerationism.<br />20% Manual distribution to the Kaspa community.<br />50% for sale (proceeds to DAO).</p>
<p>What is the ACC DAO?</p>
<p>The DAO will give grants to causes, technology, and groups that further the vision of Accelerationism. Inclusive within this DAO will be an annual conference held in Iceland and/or Vietnam. The governance of the DAO is 1 Founder = 1 Vote. Votes may be delegated with at least 6 members agreeing to the delegation. Funding must require a super-majority of 8/11 votes.</p>
