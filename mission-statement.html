            <p> $FAST Introduction </p>

              <p>The future presents itself to us more and more in the pure form of
              acceleration. This form practically engulfs us at the frontiers of
              economics, technology, and culture. Real World Assets are a simplified
              expression of the coalescence of these three manifestations of the
              primacy of acceleration.</p>
              
              <p>The FAST team consists of eleven committed artists, philosophers, and
              developers. We are committed to the Bringing an increasingly lareg
              collection of Contemporary Art on-chain. We are also naturally
              inclined to produce content and engage with the community according to
              our own idiosyncratic proclivities and preferences â€“ plugged in, but
              driven to act upon the network in turn, to feed the glitches through
              which we escape the rusty old paradigms and embrace the accelerant
              future.</p>
              
              
              <p>Art-Backed RWA Ecosystem: The volute entity known as FAST is in the
              early phases of developing a DAO. The FAST DAO has begun acquiring
              both NFTs and physical fine art as part of its strategy to become a
              real-world asset (RWA) token.</p>
              
              
              <p>The works in the DAO's collection will serve as marketing tools for
              the token, showcased through physical exhibitions around the world as
              well as online. The DAO's current collection includes pieces by Gunter
              Brus, Antonius Hoeckelmann, and Eric Schmid.</p>
              
              
              <p>Tokenization is a process that allows real-world assets (RWA) to be
              converted into digital tokens. FAST is leading the way in providing a
              secure and efficient solution for tokenizing RWAs as this industry
              continues to grow. Art is just one of these assets that can be
              tokenized. By tokenizing art, investors can own a fraction of the
              artwork without having to purchase the entire piece. This allows for
              greater access to valuable artworks and democratizes the art market.</p>
