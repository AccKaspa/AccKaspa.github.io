        <strong>Mission Statement</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Speed now illuminates reality whereas light once gave objects of
        the world their shape.&rdquo;<br />― Paul Virilio, The Administration of
        Fear
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing human makes it out of the near-future.&rdquo;<br />― Nick
        Land
      </p>
      <p>~</p>
      <p>The future is nothing but speed, nothing but acceleration.</p>
      <p>
        If Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper&rsquo;
        obscurely envisaged culture to come then Kaspa accelerates that culture
        to its terminal limit, seeking to operate as fast as internet speed
        allows. Kaspa&rsquo;s two primary vectors in terms of adding to
        Bitcoin&rsquo;s economic revolution are the speed of
        transaction-inclusion in the ledger and the control over
        transaction-ordering in the ledger.
      </p>
      <p>
        What, however, of a coin that represents only the former of
        Kaspa&rsquo;s two vectors in its purest form? A coin, the sole purpose
        of which is to represent the acceleration of economics itself? A coin of
        acceleration. An accelerationist coin. Or, FAST Coin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the words of Land, Capital is machinic (non-instrumental)
        globalization-miniaturization scaling dilation: an automatizing nihilist
        vortex, neutralizing all values through commensuration to digitized
        commerce (Meltdown), and we say, why not finally put a tokenomic face to
        the ur-plasticity that is capital and Capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>Why are we doing this?</p>
      <p>
        Because monetary economic acceleration needs a mascot, it needs a clear
        sign. Not just for the economic transaction or value, but positively for
        the speed of the economy itself. A cryptocurrency signifier of
        everything fast. A tokenized figurehead of the future arriving. In this
        manner, FAST Coin is the signifier of acceleration itself, the waymarker
        for the future, ever-accelerating up the peaks of economic oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; of FAST Coin, then, was already decided wherein
        the market first ever computed a transaction. Since that day capitalism
        has only ever been waiting for its quirky, snail representative. The
        decision to create is only ever because one can.
      </p>
      <p><br />What are we going to spend it on?</p>
      <p>
        FAST will have 100,000,000 total coins. <br />11% will go to the
        founders (1% each). <br />10% will go to the FAST DAO. <br />5% to
        liquidity.<br />1% to Nick Land<br />1% to a Landian Public Burn<br />2%
        for Grants relating to Accelerationism.<br />20% Manual distribution to
        the Kaspa community.<br />50% for sale (proceeds to DAO).
      </p>
      <p>What is the ACC DAO?</p>
      <p>
        The DAO will give grants to causes, technology, and groups that further
        the vision of Accelerationism. Inclusive within this DAO will be an
        annual conference held in Iceland and/or Vietnam. The governance of the
        DAO is 1 Founder = 1 Vote. Votes may be delegated with at least 6
        members agreeing to the delegation. Funding must require a
        super-majority of 8/11 votes.
