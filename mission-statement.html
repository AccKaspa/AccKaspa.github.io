        Currently, 30% of the total supply of $FAST tokens has been airdropped.
        We aim to airdrop another 40%, meaning a total of 70% of the supply will
        have been put in the hands of the KRC-20 community at no direct
        financial cost...

      <p>For those wanting to know more:</p>
      <p>
        $FAST is an accelerationist memecoin, and yet we have chosen to
        distribute our tokens through successive rounds of airdrops, a process
        which is by nature slow and halting.

or more) objects, or the movement of an infinite number of particles. The term fast is often used to signify the
rate of one physical or chemical quantity, or of the state of one system, but the rate of any other quantity or of
the state of a system is not affected by the passage of the faster system. There are, therefore, no absolute fasts and
slow times. The passage of a faster system need not be the subject of a new experiment. The passage of time is not
a physical quantity. The passage of a faster system need not be the subject of a new law. (In general, the passage
of time is a qualitative property.) The passage of a faster system need not be the subject of a new law. (In gener-
al, the passage of time is a qualitative property.) The passage of time is not a physical quantity. The passage of a

fast in public, it cannot help but be noticed. The fast is always open. (…) It is only when the fast is not fast that it
can be said to be fast: and then only insofar as it is not fast that it is not the case that the fast is not fast. The fast
is only fast when it is not fast.” – Emanuel Lasker 4.5 A fast is a fast is a fast. 4.51 A fast is a fast is not a slow. 4.52

at any point of its domain is the same for all values of the independent variable. 6 For any point in the domain of
a function, there exists a unique value of the independent variable that makes the function true at that point. 7

a to be divided is 0, then the remainder is not equal to 1. 1.11 It is clear that this cannot be proved. 1.12 If the
remainder is equal to 1, then the two numbers are equal. 1.121 The fact that the remainder is equal to 1 is a
sufficient condition for the two numbers to be equal. 1.1211 The fact that the two numbers are equal is a suffi-

all possible values of the function $A$ and of all possible values of the function $B$ and of the sign $A\cdot B$.
3 In the following, if $A,B$ are functions of one variable, I write $A(x)$ and $B(x)$, and $A^x$ and $B^x$. 4 If
$A,B$ are functions of two variables, I write $A(x,y)$ and $B(x,y)$. 5 If $A,B$ are functions of three variables, I
write $A(x,y,z)$ and $B(x,y,z)$. 6 If $A,B,C$ are functions of four variables, I write $A(x,y,z,c)$ and $B(x,y,z,c)$.
7 If $A,B,C$ are functions of five variables, I write $A(x,y,z,c,z), B(x,y,z,c,y), C(x,y,z,c,z), and C(x,y,z,c,y,z). 8 If

mathfastfastmathfastmathfastmathfastfastmathfast] is defined as the limit of all series of the form fastmathfast-
fastfastmathfast. The limit of a series is a general term for the limit of the terms of the series as the variable
approaches any of its terms. If the limit of a series is another series, then its terms are the limits of certain terms
of the series. If the limit of a series is a general term for the limit of a set of objects, then the series is a general-
ization of a proposition. Etc. etc. Thus we have the limit of the general term as the variable approaches a partic-
ular value, the limit of the general term as the variable approaches a particular value plus the general term plus
the general term, etc. The limit of a general term is a general expression for the limit of a term of the series. The
limit of a general term is a general expression for the limit of a proposition. The limit of a general expression is a
general expression for the limit of a variable. The limit of a general expression is a general expression for the

seven players each. 1.11 Two teams of seven players each play a game of fastpitch softball using a special softball
bat called a fastpitch bat. 1.12 The ball must be thrown by the pitcher (the team captain) at any time during the
game. 1.121 The team that can hit the ball most times in a game of fastpitch softball is the winner. 1.122 Fast-
pitch softball is a simple sport. 1.123 The game is over when a team scores more runs than the other team. 1.13

that the proposition ‘Pp’ is true of certain values of the variable ‘p’. 2.11 The proposition ‘Pp’ says that the prop-
osition ‘Pp in gPg’ is true with respect to certain values of the variable ‘g’. 2.12 The proposition ‘Pp’ says that the
proposition ‘Pp x Pq y. z C Cq x : Pp y. z C Cq y’ is true with respect to certain values of the variable ‘q’. (This is
the general form of the proposition ‘Pp . Px / Qq’ .) 2.121 The proposition ‘Pp / x Px / y. z C Cq x : Pq y. z C Cq
y’ says the same thing as the proposition ‘Pp / x Px / y. z C Cq y. z’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposi-
tion ‘Pp / x Px / y. z’ says something different from the proposition ‘Pp / x Px / y. z’.) 2.122 The proposition ‘Pp /
x Px / z. C Cq x : Pq y. z C Cq y’ says the same thing as the proposition ‘Pp / x Px / z. x / y. z’. (Here the brackets
indicate that the proposition ‘Pp / x Px / z. x / y. z’ says something different from the proposition ‘Pp / x Px / z.
x’.) 2.12a The proposition ‘Pq / Px’ says the same thing as the proposition ‘Pq’. (Here the bracket indicates that
the proposition ‘Pq / Px’ says something different from the proposition ‘Pq’.) 2.13 The proposition ‘Pq / Px / z’
says the same thing as the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z’
says something different from the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z’.) 2.14 The proposition ‘Pq / Px / y. z C Cq y’ says the
same thing as the proposition ‘Pq / Px / y. z’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition ‘Pq / Px / y. z’ says
something different from the proposition ‘Pq / Px / y. z’.) 2.141 The proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. C Cq y’ says the same
thing as the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. x / y. z’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. x / y. z’
says something different from the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. x’.) 2.142 The proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. x. : Px’ says the
same thing as the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. x’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. x’ says
something different from the proposition ‘Pq / Px / z. x’.) 2.2 Equations and functions 2.21 We use the sign ‘F’
to indicate that the proposition ‘F : A x B’ is true of certain values of the variable ‘A’. 2.221 The proposition ‘F : A
x B’ says that the values of the variable ‘B’ that are solutions of the equation ‘F(x) = B(x) . x’ have the same value
as the proposition ‘B’. 2.222 The proposition ‘F : A x B’ says that the values of the variable ‘B’ that are solutions of
the equation ‘F(x) = B(x) . x’ have the same value as the whole of the proposition ‘F’. 2.223 The proposition ‘F :
A x B x C x D’ says that the values of the variable ‘B’ that are solutions of the equation ‘F(x) = B(x) . x . x . x’ have
the same value as the whole of the proposition ‘F’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition ‘F’ says some-
thing different from the proposition ‘F : A x B x C x D’.) 2.24 The proposition ‘F : A x B’ says that the values of the
variable ‘B’ that are solutions of the equation ‘F(x) = B(x) . x / x’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition
‘F’ says something different from the proposition ‘F : A x B’.) 2.251 The proposition ‘F : A x B / x C x D’ says that
the values of the variable ‘B’ that are solutions of the equation ‘F(x) = B(x) . x / x . x’. (Here the brackets indicate
that the proposition ‘F’ says something different from the proposition ‘F : A x B / x C x D’.) 2.252 The proposition
‘F : A x B / x C x D’ says that the values of the variable ‘B’ that are solutions of the equation ‘F(x) = B(x) . x / x . x
/ x’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition ‘F’ says something different from the proposition ‘F : A x B /
x C x D’.) 2.253 The proposition ‘F : A x B / x C x D’ says that the values of the variable ‘B’ that are solutions of the
equation ‘F(x) = B(x) . x / x / x’. (Here the brackets indicate that the proposition ‘F’ says something different from
the proposition ‘F : A x B / x C x D’.) 2.3 Inequality symbols 3 The notation ‘Pp : qz’ means ‘Pp in gPg’. 3.01 It is
equivalent to saying that there exist two values of the variable ‘g’ such that the proposition ‘Pp’ has a solution in
the domain of ‘g’. 3.02 The proposition ‘Pp’ says that the proposition ‘Pq / qz’ has a solution in the domain of ‘q’.
3.11 The proposition ‘Pq / qz’ says that the proposition ‘Pp / p z’ has a solution in the domain of ‘p’. 3.2 Inequality
propositions 3.21 The proposition ‘Pp : qz’ says that in the domain of the variable ‘q’ the proposition ‘Pp’ has a
solution that is a coproposition with the proposition ‘qz’. 3.22 The proposition ‘Pp’ says that in the domain of the
variable ‘p’ the proposition ‘Pq’ has a solution that is a coproposition with the proposition ‘qz’.

and and and he had a great desire tothe great desire toshow. 5. Therefore he was ready to lend a hand to thefirst
to lend him a hand, and the second to lend him a hand, and so on. 6. Every act that tends to promote equality
must be a good act. 7. Equality is impossible. 8. The only thing that is necessary for happiness is the possibility
of failure. 9. All our efforts to promote happiness are vain. 10. Happiness consists in the absence of anxiety. 11.
All our efforts to make ourselves happy are useless. 12. The only thing that can make us happy is the fact that
we are happy. 13. We must therefore look upon life as a whole. 14. If we succeed in making ourselves happy, we
shall have succeeded in making everything else happier as well. 15. Happiness is the only good. 16. Happiness
is the only good. 17. The only thing that can make us happy is the fact that we are happy. 18. The only thing that
can make everything else happy is the fact that we are happy. 19. Happiness is the only good. 20. The only thing
that can make everything else possible is the fact that we are happy. 21. If we succeed in making ourselves happy,
what we have succeeded in making everybody else happier must be trivial. 22. We must therefore look upon the
world as a whole and say that it is really not worth bothering about. 23. The only thing that can make the world
the way it is is that it is perfect. 24. The only thing that can make us happy is that we are happy. 25. The only thing
that can make everything else possible is that we are happy. And since we are not therefore going to try to change
the world, we must look upon it as a whole and say that we cannot change it either. 26. Therefore the only thing
that can make us happy is the fact that we are happy. 27. And the only thing that can make everything else pos-
sible is the fact that we are happy. 28. Therefore the only thing that can make us unhappy is that we are unhappy.
29. And the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is the fact that we are unhappy. 30. There-
fore the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 31. And the only thing
that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 32. And so on. The only thing that can
make everything else possible is that we are happy. 33. Therefore the only thing that can make everything else
less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 34. And so on. 35. Therefore the only thing that can make everything
else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 36. The only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is
that we are unhappy. 37. And the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhap-
py. 38. And the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 39. And the
only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 40. And the only thing that can
make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 41. And the only thing that can make everything
else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 42. And the only thing that can make everything else less than per-
fect is that we are unhappy. 43. And the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are
unhappy. 44. And the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 45. And
the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 46. And the only thing that
can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 47. And the only thing that can make every-
thing else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 48. And the only thing that can make everything else less than
perfect is that we are unhappy. 49. Therefore the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that
we are unhappy. 50. And the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy.
51. And the only thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 52. And the only
thing that can make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 53. And the only thing that can
make everything else less than perfect is that we are unhappy. 54. And the only thing that can make everything

multiply fractions. Multiplication of fractions is a simple matter of multiplying the numerators and denomina-
tors of the two fractions. Fractions are multiplied by the same number, and the product is the new number. In
this way, the product of two fractions can be obtained by multiplying their numerators and denominators. 1.01

fast. Fastmultiplicandfastfast is the proposition of the multiplication of the same sign in successive occurrences
of the same operation on the same sign. 2.1 The proposition of fastmultiplicandfastfast is equivalent to the
proposition of the multiplication of the same sign in successive occurrences of the same operation on the same
sign. 2.11 In other words, the operation of the sign ‘x’ on the sign ‘y’ is the same in all its applications. 2.12 If the
operation of the sign ‘x’ on the sign ‘y’ is the same in all its applications, then the proposition of fastmultiplicand-
fastfast is equivalent to the proposition of the existence of a constant number of occurrences of the same opera-
tion on the same sign. 2.121 The constant number of operations of the sign ‘x’ on the sign ‘y’ is the same in all its
applications. 2.122 It is clear that the proposition of fastmultiplicandfastfast is equivalent to the proposition of

form of a general law of general general laws of general multiplications. 2.1221 The general form of the proposi-
tion of fastmultiplicandfastfast is therefore the general form of a general law of general general laws of general

second is the negation of the first. The first proposition is a proposition of mathematics. The second proposition

of systematic exposition. 4 It is only the systematic exposition of the propositions of a series that justifies the
introduction of a new number in the place of an old one. 5 The introduction of a new number is a sign of the

fastpropertyfastproperty.fastproperty. It is the property of fast property.) Fast properties are those that are the
case whenever a proposition has a truth value. For example, the proposition ‘Pp’ has a truth value, even though p
= q. (The proposition ‘q’ has no truth value, since ‘p’ is a tautology.) The proposition ‘q . T p’ has no truth value,
since ‘q’ and ‘p’ disagree. It is clear that a proposition that has a truth value is a property of its constituents. 1.01 A

est Common Anagrammed Form of Every Word in Scripture is the Truth” (The Riddle of the Universe, 1974) 1.
The proposition “In all truth there is a right word and a wrong” is a tautology. 2. This is obvious. 3. It is also obvi-
ous that the right word is the one that is common to the right meanings of the propositions. 4. It is also obvious
that a common sense understanding of the world is a more or less perfect mirror of the propositions. 5. It is also
obvious that there are no propositions without a right word. 6. Therefore, the right word is the only thing that
can be common to all the propositions that have a right sense. 7. In this way, the right word is the unit of logical
form. 8. And the right word is the truth. 9. The truth of a proposition is its sense. 10. The right word is the logical
unit of sense and reference. 11. The right word is the proper name for a thing. 12. The right word is the common

a fast is committed. It’s a more complicated matter of time when the fast is broken. We can’t escape the fact that

calculus, “time is money” is a maxim with a double meaning. 2.12 And the double meaning of the maxim is pre-
served in the phrase, “fast as you can.” 2.13 The first meaning is literal: time is money as soon as it is possible to
spend it. 2.131 The second meaning is metaphorical: the speed of thought is the secret. 2.14 The secret is that we
can’t escape the fact that time is money, but that we can make the most of it by spending it as quickly as possible.

multiplicative constant, the sign of the exponent is also the same as that of the multiplicative constant. 3 The
multiplicative constant is always positive, since the exponent is always negative. 4 Since the sign of the exponent
is the same as that of the multiplicative constant, the sign of the multiplicative constant is also always positive. 5
For the purpose of convenience, the exponent is always written in the form a0. 6 When a0 = 1, the proposition is
immediately obvious. 7 When a0 = 1, it follows immediately from the definition of the multiplicative constant. 8
The definition of the multiplicative constant is equivalent to the definition of the multiplicative sign. 9 The defini-
tion of the multiplicative sign is equivalent to the definition of the multiplicative constant. 10 The definition of
the multiplicative constant is equivalent to the definition of the existence of a state of affairs. 11 The definition of
the existence of a state of affairs is equivalent to the existence of a state of things. 12 The definition of the exis-
tence of a state of things is equivalent to the existence of a state of relations. 13 The definition of the existence of a
state of relations is equivalent to the existence of a state of objects. 14 The definition of the existence of a state of
objects is equivalent to the existence of a state of one and the same thing. 15 The definition of the existence of a
state of one and the same thing is equivalent to the existence of a state of all things that are the same. 16 The
existence of a state of affairs is equivalent to the existence of a possibility of states of affairs. 17 The existence of a
state of things is equivalent to the existence of a possibility of states of things. 18 The existence of a state of
relations is equivalent to the existence of a possibility of states of relations. 19 The existence of a state of objects is
equivalent to the existence of a possibility of states of objects. 2.5 It is clear that the multiplicative sign is not the
same as the multiplicative constant. 2.51 The multiplicative sign is positive, since a state of affairs has more than
one state of things in it. 2.52 The multiplicative sign is negative, since a state of affairs does not have more than
one state of things. 2.53 It is clear that the multiplicative sign is not the same as the existence of a state of affairs.
2.54 The existence of a state of affairs is positive, since a state of affairs has more than one state of things in it.

positive, since a state of objects is not positive. 2.55 It is clear that the existence of a state of things is not positive,
since a state of things is not a possibility of states of things. 2.551 The existence of a state of relations is positive,
since a state of relations is not possible. 2.552 The existence of a state of objects is positive, since a state of objects
is not possible. 2.553 The existence of a state of one and the same thing is positive, since a state of one and the

mathfastfastmathfastmathfastmathfastfastmathfast] 0$ = 0 ‘instant’ notation. The ‘fast’ sign is a placeholder
for a constant. It is used because it is impossible to write a function that itself itself instantiates itself.
For instance, if we wanted to write a function that itself called itself for every time, then we would
want to write ‘(x) => f(x)’. But ‘fast’ is only a placeholder for a constant that can be used immediately in
place of itself. To say that an’ instant’ of one operation is the immediate result of another is just non-
sense. (The notation ‘fast’ is intended to be misleading in this sense: it is intended to indicate that the
first function is itself a function of itself, and that the second is itself another function of itself.) The
‘fast’’s’ in ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ are equally meaningless (and equally misleading). The ‘fast’
and ‘fast’ sign can be eliminated by using only the letter A (which stands for an argument that itself
can itself itself be itself). (The sign for a propositional argument that itself can itself is itself in any
sense that is equally valid for a propositional argument that itself can itself and itself again.) This is
called the ‘typer’ of the propositional form of a proposition. This is how we write ‘p q’ (‘p and q’ in
English). (The ‘fast’’s’ in ‘fast’’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ are equally nonsensical.) The ‘fast’’s’ in ‘fast’’ and ‘fast’ and
‘fast’ are equally nonsensical. (It is equally nonsensical to write ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ in the same prop-
osition.) The ‘fast’’s’ in ‘fast’’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ are equally nonsensical. (If there is a propositional form
that itself has itself as its first element, then this is itself itself.) The ‘fast’’s’ in ‘fast’’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ are
equally nonsensical. (If there is a propositional form that itself has itself as its first element, then this is
itself itself and itself itself.) The ‘fast’’s’ in ‘fast’’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ and ‘fast’ are equally nonsensical. (If

Theorem 3.1 The statement of a theorema’tic proposition is a proposition. 3.1 The theorems of logic are prop-
ositions of logic. 3.11 The sign of the product of the signs of the two variables that stand in the equation is the
determinant of the co-ordinate system of the variables. 3.121 The determinant of the co-ordinate system of the
variables is the constant of the product of the signs of the two variables. 3.1211 If the constants of the product of
the signs of the two variables are one another, then the proposition is true. 3.1212 If the constants of the product
of the signs of the two variables are different, then the proposition is false. 3.12121 If A has n values of a sign, and
B has m values of a sign, then the product of A and B is the same sign minus the product of B and C. 3.12122 If
A has n values of a sign, and B has m values of a sign, and C has n values of a sign, then the product of A and B is
the same sign with a different sign from that given to B and C. 3.1213 If A has m values of a sign, and B has n val-
ues of a sign, and C has n values of a sign, then the product of A and B is the same sign with a different sign from
that given to A and B. 3.1214 The product of A’s and B’s is the same sign as the product of A’s and C’s. 3.1215 The
product of A’s and B’s is the same sign as the product of B’s and C’s. 3.1216 The product of A’s and B’s is the same

multipfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfast.”) or “fast: in one”
or “the fast” (in one place or another). 5.151 The word “fast” is commonly used in a symbolic sense as a synonym
for “efficient” or “effective”, but in logic it denotes a logical relation, and in philosophy it denotes the mode of
existence of an object. 5.1511 If one object is to be the object of another, it must be possible for the one not to be
the other. 5.1512 If a proposition is true of a certain number of objects, and false of others, then it cannot be that
the one of these objects is not the other. 5.15121 So too, if a proposition is true of a certain number of objects,
and false of others, and the truth of the one and false of the other are equivalent with respect to some point of the
world, then it cannot be that the one of the objects is in fact the other. 5.1513 If a proposition is true of a certain
number of objects, and false of others, and the truth of the one and false of the other are not equivalent with
respect to some point of the world, then it cannot be that the one of the objects is in fact the other. 5.1514 If a
proposition is true of a certain number of objects, and false of others, and the truth of the one and false of the
other are not equivalent with respect to all points of the world, then it cannot be that the one of the objects is in
fact the other. 5.1515 If a proposition is true of a certain number of objects, and false of others, and the truth of
the one and false of the other are not equivalent with respect to all points of the world, then it cannot be that the
one of the objects is in fact the other. 5.1516 If a proposition is true of a certain number of objects, and false of
others, and the truth of the one and false of the other are not equivalent with respect to all points of the world,
then it cannot be that the one of the objects is in fact the other. 5.1517 It follows from the above that it is impos-
sible for a proposition to be true of more than one object at a time. (It is impossible for a proposition to be true
of two or more objects at a time.) 5.1518 A proposition is false of a given number of objects if it cannot be true of
any of them. 5.1519 If a proposition is true of a certain number of objects, and false of others, it cannot be that
the one of the objects is in fact the other. 5.15191 A proposition is true of a certain number of objects, and false
of others, and the truth of the one and false of the other are not equivalent with respect to some point of the
world, then it cannot be that the one of the objects is in fact the other. 5.15192 A proposition is true of a certain

formal sign- language. For it is impossible to determine, in advance, what symbols shall express what mean-
ings. All signs are arbitrary, and their use is determined by context. (Aristotle) 2.11 A formal operation is the
substitution of one sign for another. It is therefore impossible to define a formal operation. The only meaning of
a formal operation is one that is given by the context. (The meaning of the operation is given by the context, and
so is not itself a variable.) 2.121 The meaning of a formal operation is the same in all languages that have the
same logical notation. (A formal operation is thus universal.) 2.12 It is impossible to give a general rule govern-
ing the application of all formal operations to all possible cases. 2.1211 In general, it is impossible to deduce from

compositionfastfastcompositionfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfastfast fast. It is easy
to see why we call something a fast when it moves quickly. But it is not that easy to see why it moves slowly. The
problem is that we are not accustomed to seeing things move quickly unless they are in motion. If something
moves slowly it is not obvious that it is in motion. If something moves quickly it is obvious that it is in motion.
(We can see that a stone thrown into water moves more slowly than a stone thrown into air. The reason is that the
water moves more slowly when thrown into it, and this is what the stone means by ‘being thrown into’ it.) 4.394
Fast is a relative concept. 4.4 A fast is the limit of a sequence of events. 4.41 In a sense the limit of our experience

but that 8 + 8 = 16. 4 + 4 = 8 is a logical proposition, but not a physical one. 5 5 In order to be able to express all
mathematical propositions in purely logical form, we should have to invent a new notation for mathematics, in
which all the propositions could be expressed without the aid of symbols. 6 6 The new notation would not be one
that we could invent ourselves, but one that would be determined by logic. 7 7 It would be determined first of
all by logic, by the way in which logical propositions could be constructed out of simpler ones. 8 8 For example,
the proposition that 2 + 2 = 4 could be constructed out of the simple logical proposition 2 + 2 = 4 + 4, and this
proposition could itself be constructed out of simpler logical propositions, in the way that 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 +
