        <strong>Mission Statement</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="p1">ATTENTION SNAILHEADS:</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">$FAST project update - <span class="s1">蜗牛头军队总部</span></p>
<p class="p4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Currently, 30% of the total supply of $FAST tokens has been airdropped. We aim to airdrop another 40%, meaning a total of 70% of the supply will have been put in the hands of the KRC-20 community at no direct financial cost. The rest will be used as specified on our website, including 15% to the DAO and 11% to the team (don&rsquo;t trust people when they tell you they&rsquo;re doing it all for free, but rather when they have a vested interest in working for the long-term good of the project&mdash;its vision, its community, its token)</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The decision to pre-mint and thus take 100% control of the supply in the beginning (as well as 100% responsibility for its distribution) was based on multiple factors:</p>
<p class="p1">1) the desire to reward $FAST followers and early participants in the KRC-20 ecosystem with a largescale airdrop;</p>
<p class="p1">2) concerns over sophisticated actors gaming the mint and taking control of the supply; and</p>
<p class="p1">3) the realization that there would be a significant net benefit to cheaply pre-minting the tokens ourselves, thereby avoiding the high transaction fees incurred during the launch of KRC-20 due to network congestion as well as other risks to ourselves and the community.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we plan to airdrop the remaining 40% of $FAST tokens set aside for the purpose. If you have not already done so, follow our instructions on Twitter (quote tweet with a Kaspa address followed by the snail emoji) and you will be added to the airdrop list. If you have already received an airdrop or are already on the list for the next round, be aware that we also aim to reward higher quality forms of community engagement.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">For those wanting to know more:</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">$FAST is an accelerationist memecoin, and yet we have chosen to distribute our tokens through successive rounds of airdrops, a process which is by nature slow and halting.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">It is slow because it takes time to collect a significant volume of addresses from community of unique users in the fledgling KRC-20 ecosystem. The factor of time may nevertheless be a good thing. Rather than pulling addresses haphazardly, we reward people who demonstrate active involvement with the $FAST project and the KRC-20 ecosystem more broadly. Meanwhile, we are able to contribute our own memetic vision to the latter. We have been there for the drama, we have willfully made ourselves a part of it, we relish its energy and create from it.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">As has been said before, the $FAST team consists of committed artists, philosophers, and developers. We are committed to the Kaspa technology and the thought which goes into it. We are also naturally inclined to produce content and engage with the community according to our own idiosyncratic proclivities and preferences. The fact that we are driven by our own tastes might come across as a little bit idealistic at times, even irresponsibly so, but we always adapt as we drive the situation forward.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Our own established styles also naturally come with aversions. The paradoxical situation is that maintaining aversions is key to staying $FAST, but maintaining aversions comes with a perceived slowness. We do not deliver generic, insipid, easily digestible patinas which give the false impression of exposing ourselves once and for all.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Engaging the accelerationist paradigm sharpens your sense of time, but inevitably exacerbates your sense of its glitchiness as you escape the old paradigms. We expose ourselves as time-based inexistences. As for the snail, it holds its own, finds its place, does not hide or demand anything but can&rsquo;t avoid imparting its slime trail.</p>

        &ldquo;Speed now illuminates reality whereas light once gave objects of
        the world their shape.&rdquo;<br />― Paul Virilio, The Administration of
        Fear

        &ldquo;Nothing human makes it out of the near-future.&rdquo;<br />― Nick
        Land

      <p>~</p>
      <p>The future is nothing but speed, nothing but acceleration.</p>
      <p>
        If Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper&rsquo;
        obscurely envisaged culture to come then Kaspa accelerates that culture
        to its terminal limit, seeking to operate as fast as internet speed
        allows. Kaspa&rsquo;s two primary vectors in terms of adding to
        Bitcoin&rsquo;s economic revolution are the speed of
        transaction-inclusion in the ledger and the control over
        transaction-ordering in the ledger.
      </p>
      <p>
        What, however, of a coin that represents only the former of
        Kaspa&rsquo;s two vectors in its purest form? A coin, the sole purpose
        of which is to represent the acceleration of economics itself? A coin of
        acceleration. An accelerationist coin. Or, FAST Coin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the words of Land, Capital is machinic (non-instrumental)
        globalization-miniaturization scaling dilation: an automatizing nihilist
        vortex, neutralizing all values through commensuration to digitized
        commerce (Meltdown), and we say, why not finally put a tokenomic face to
        the ur-plasticity that is capital and Capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>Why are we doing this?</p>
      <p>
        Because monetary economic acceleration needs a mascot, it needs a clear
        sign. Not just for the economic transaction or value, but positively for
        the speed of the economy itself. A cryptocurrency signifier of
        everything fast. A tokenized figurehead of the future arriving. In this
        manner, FAST Coin is the signifier of acceleration itself, the waymarker
        for the future, ever-accelerating up the peaks of economic oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; of FAST Coin, then, was already decided wherein
        the market first ever computed a transaction. Since that day capitalism
        has only ever been waiting for its quirky, snail representative. The
        decision to create is only ever because one can.
      </p>
      <p><br />What are we going to spend it on?</p>
      <p>
        FAST will have 100,000,000 total coins. <br>


70% Manual distribution to the Kaspa community<br>
15% FAST DAO<br>
11% Team<br>
1% Nick Land<br>
1% Landian Public Burn<br>
2% Grants relating to Accelerationism.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
       
      <p>What is the ACC DAO?</p>
      <p>
        The DAO will give grants to causes, technology, and groups that further
        the vision of Accelerationism. Inclusive within this DAO will be an
        annual conference held in Iceland and/or Vietnam. The governance of the
        DAO is 1 Founder = 1 Vote. Votes may be delegated with at least 6
        members agreeing to the delegation. Funding must require a
        super-majority of 8/11 votes.
